Create an account on Codeforces. This would be the platform on which contests would be held, so we advise you to get well acquainted with how to go about solving problems on the site. If you face any problems check out this document.
Create a GitHub account, preferably using your BITS email (gives you free student access, and lots of perks).
Fill out this form, and join the group on Codeforces.
You have to learn and practice a few basic problem solving techniques to prepare for the contest. The following would be the basics that we suggest you to learn:
Data types (not needed for Python), such as the range of int vs long long in C++
The in-built sorting function in the language of your choice
Performing linear and binary search for an element within an array
Taking strings as inputs, and iterating over them
Identifying the time and space complexity of a piece of code
Here are some resources to get you started (you don't have to do these specifically, just make sure that you are well-acquanted with the above topics):
Data types
In-built sorting
Binary search
Time and Space complexities
Here are some problems that you should try to solve before the first contest. You can ask us for help with these problems if you want, since they are just for your practice. Youâ€™ll have to submit solutions for all the problems by 4th February EOD in order to take part in the contest. We strongly encourage you to try all of them yourself as the contest will have similar problems.
Multiples of 3 and 5
Repetitions
Two Sum
Password Encryption
Manish and Manisha
The non hyperlinked problems are available on the Codeforces group (register for the "Recruitments Task #1" contest to access them).

You have to submit a GitHub repository and upload your solution codes to all these problems. Mark the repository as private and add all of the following accounts as collaborators: Anish-aak, brobat6 and Utkarsh-UTK.
