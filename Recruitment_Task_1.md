# Task #1

****
 
1. Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account, preferably using your BITS email (gives you free student access, and lots of perks). 
2. Fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/hFoTqptioqCUtf8bA), and join the [group](https://codeforces.com/group/d7S7vmPWmS/contests) on Codeforces.
4. You have to learn and practice a few basic problem solving techniques to prepare for the contest. The following would be the basics that we suggest you to learn:
   1. **Data types** (not needed for Python), such as the range of ```int``` vs ```long long``` in C++
   2. The in-built **sorting** function in the language of your choice
   3. Performing **linear and binary search** for an element within an array
   4. Taking **strings** as inputs, and iterating over them
   5. Identifying the **time and space** complexity of a piece of code
5. Here are some resources to get you started (you don't have to do these specifically, just make sure that you are well-acquanted with the above topics):
   1. [Data types](https://usaco.guide/general/data-types?lang=cpp)
   2. [In-built sorting](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/know-sorting-algorithm-set-1-sorting-weapons-used-programming-languages/)
   3. [Binary search](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search/)
   4. [Time and Space complexities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TlHvipP5yA&t=2s)
6. Here are some problems that you should try to solve before the first contest. You can ask us for help with these problems if you want, since they are just for your practice. Youâ€™ll have to submit solutions for all the problems by **4th December EOD** in order to take part in the contest. We strongly encourage you to try all of them yourself as the contest will have similar problems.
   1. [Sum Square Difference](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges/euler006/problem)
   2. [Weird Algorithm](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1068)
   3. Two Sum
   4. Password Encryption
   5. Manish and Manisha
> The non hyperlinked problems are available on the Codeforces group (register for the "Recruitments Task #1" contest to access them).
7. You have to submit a GitHub repository and upload your solution codes to all these problems. Mark the repository as **private** and add all of the following accounts as collaborators: [Anish-aak](https://github.com/Anish-aak), [brobat6](https://github.com/brobat6) and [Utkarsh-UTK](https://github.com/Utkarsh-UTK).
